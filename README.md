# Breakout game

A classic breakout game with retro Tron vibes. 

Players mission is to destroy all of the bricks thath line the top of the screen. Player has three lives to do this.

There is two versions of the game. They are otherwise the same but the game canvases are different size. 
In this way game can run smoothier and prettier with different sized screens.
